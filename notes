REACT
- Composition with Components (Element)
- ReactDOM
- Declarative UI
- Pure Javascript
- Redux

-> Babel
-> Webpack
-> Routing (React Router)
-> Styling (Traditional CSS vs CSS in JS (styled components))
-> Redux (when React's state is not enough)

WEBPACK
- Bundle stuff
- Entrypoint and Output
- Transformations with Loaders (Babel, CSS, SVG...)
- Plugins
- Mode

JSX
- React.Fragment for more than one element returned by a render

PROPS
- Props are the arguments of Components
- Props can be any kind of JS object
- <Component name="Test"> => this.props.name

LISTS
- list.map((item) => (<div>{item.name}</div>))
- a list needs a key=item.id so that React can distinguish the elements
