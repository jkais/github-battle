WHAT'S REDUX
- Shared state tree
- State resides outside of Components
- Components can then be Pure Functions
- Get - Listen - Update

Simple Store
- Reducer functions define (pure) functions how to change the state
- subscribe (and unsubscribe) to listen to changes
- Dispatch actions from Reducer to modify the state and then call the listeners
